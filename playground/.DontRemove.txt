DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE!

Since Mercurial does not track directories but only files,  this file is
needed to keep  directory "playground/"  in the repo accross clones even
when there currently aren't any articles in development and thus direct-
ory "playground/" is logically empty,  that is,  it does not contain any
"*.md" files.
