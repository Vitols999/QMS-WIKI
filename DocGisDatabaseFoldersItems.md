The items won't be stored into the database unless you explicitly save the changes to the database folder. With 'Save As...' you can export the database folder into a file.

After saving  the project you will see the list of items in the database view. You load and unload single items by their checkboxes. The folders checkbox will  load or unload all items within the folder, but no subfolders.
