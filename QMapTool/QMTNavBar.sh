# Replace the original navigation links  in the file specified as second
# parameter with a slightly more sophisticated navigation bar,  and also
# insert this navigation bar at the bottom of the file.  Both navigation
# bars provide  a "Prev"  and a "Next" link  for easier navigation while
# reading.   The target information  required for these additional links
# is retrieved from the table of contents file specified as first param-
# eter.
#
# And if the second file already features navigation bars at the top and
# at the bottom, update the information in them according to the current
# contents of the first file.

# Define the URL to the online documentation wiki on the Bitbucket serv-
# er, the regular expression matching the default footnote place marker,
# and the regular expression  matching lines belonging to old navigation
# bars:

bitbucket='https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/wiki/'
footnote='///Footnotes Go Here///$'
navbar='[[](Home|Prev)[]]|Prev [(][)]|- - -$|[[]TOC[]]$'

#
# Variable "nb"  contains the constant  common text part  of the top and
# bottom navigation bars.
#
# The regular expression in variable "r0"  matches any line specifying a
# default footnote place marker or belonging to an already existing nav-
# igation bar.
#
# The regular expression  in variable "r1"  matches any inline or refer-
# ence-style link to a file in the online documentation wiki on the Bit-
# bucket server.  The first parenthesized sub-expression matches the be-
# gin of the link definition up to but excluding the Bitbucket URL.
#
# The regular expression  in variable "r2"  matches any inline or refer-
# ence-style link  to a local file specified with  ".html" or ".md" ext-
# ension.   The first parenthesized  sub-expression matches the begin of
# the link definition up to but excluding this extension.
#
# The regular expression  in variable "r3"  matches any inline or refer-
# ence-style link  to a local file  with a fragment  identifier starting
# with the Bitbucket "markdown-header-" prefix.  The first parenthesized
# sub-expression matches the begin of the  link definition up to and in-
# cluding the "#" character.
#
# The regular expression  in variable "r4"  matches any inline or refer-
# ence-style link  to a local file  with a fragment identifier  not con-
# taining a colon.   The first parenthesized  sub-expression matches the
# begin of the link definition  up to and  including the  "#" character,
# while the third  parenthesized sub-expression matches the fragment id-
# entifier including  its delimiting character,  provided the identifier
# isn't delimited by the end of the line.
#
# The regular expression in variable "r5"  matches lines with links con-
# tributing to the  table of contents.   The first parenthesized sub-ex-
# pression matches the  link description  while the second parenthesized
# sub-expression matches the link target.
#
# To prevent MinGW "gawk" on Windows  from producing  Windows-style line
# ends  we set MinGW specific "gawk" variable  "BINMODE" to "w" and just

# separator) to just "\n":
