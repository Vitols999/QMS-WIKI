[Read this if you want to **report a bug**](ReportBugs).

# Preface

Feature requests are [managed using the Bitbucket Issue page](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/issues?status=new&status=open).

Keep in mind that you are asking a stranger to spend time/work for you - be kind and try to support him/her as good as you can.

# Things to include in your request

Try to be as accurate as possible; don't assume we'll just "know".

The request should be **self-contained**, avoid untraceable references (such as `as discussed on IRC`).

1. Give a **detailed description** of what you want and **why it is of general interest** (in your opinion). Just because software XYZ does it, is a bad reason.
2. Sketch in detail how you think the feature should be integrated into the GUI or the workflow.
3. If possible, **provide ressources** (such as icons) required when implementing your feature.

**Do not assign the feature request to anyone!** It will be assigned when someone volunteers to implement it.


## Implement it yourself

Your **best chance** to get a new feature is to **implement it on your own** (see section [Developing QMapShack](DeveloperCodingGuideline)).
