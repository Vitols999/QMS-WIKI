# Frequently Asked Questions - Maps

## How to control visibility of POI info?

(_Inspired by_ [newsgroup discussion](https://www.naviboard.de/thread/61038-detailgrad-hier-freizeitkarte/))

The possibility to control the POI visibility in QMS map windows depends on the type of the displayed map:

* _Raster and online maps:_ All map info is hard-coded in the map. Visibility of map elements (POI, roads, ...) can't be changed within QMS.
* _Vector maps:_ The QMS user has various ways to control the display of the information contained in a map:
    * _Using the maps tab:_ (if closed, open it with the help of the menu entry `Window - Maps`) After clicking the small triangle at the front of an active map
      the following map display options can be modified:
        * _Map opacity_. Use slider to increase or decrease map opacity. This controls the visibility of maps in a stack of active maps.
        * _Zoom levels for map display_. Select minimum resp. maximum zoom level of map display by clicking the small buttons at the left resp. right of the scale.
          If the zoom level slider is in the green interval, then the map is displayed.
        * _Type of displayed map objects_. Use the checkboxes to switch on or off the display of areas, lines, and points (POI).  
        * _Details level_. Use levels between -5 and 5 to select the amount of map objects for a given zoom level. 
    * _Using the main menu_. 
        * The menu entry `View - POI Text` is a toggle. If it is selected, then the name of a POI (if available in the map) is displayed. The font used can be changed
          with the help of the menu entry `View - Setup Map Font.`
        * The menu entry `View - Map Tooltip` is a toggle. If it is selected, then after moving the mouse pointer to a map object (POI, line, area) in a vector map a small tooltip window pops-up with information about the object (typically, the name of the object is shown).
 
__Remarks:__

* Several (vector) maps may have the same data source (e.g. OpenStreetMap/OSM). It is up to the author/publisher of the map to select
    * the data to be included in the map, 
    * the style in which the data is displayed,
    * the zoom levels at which data objects are displayed. 
  
    Thus, maps having the same data source may have rather different
    content and layout. QMS cannot alter this map data. 

* Workspace GIS data (waypoints, tracks, routes, areas) is drawn on an extra layer on the map window. The rules described above for map data don't apply to GIS data.
  The display of GIS data is controlled via checkboxes in the workspace.

## Why are waypoints shown with a blue dot icon?

**Source:** [Newsgroup discussion](https://sourceforge.net/p/qlandkartegt/mailman/message/35441910/)

_Example:_

![Blue dot waypoint icon](images/DocFaq/BlueDots.jpg "Blue dot waypoint icon")

The blue dots shown on the map are not the icons of waypoints but they are used as indicators that at the given zoom level
of the map and the given locations there are several waypoints on the map. Thus, cluttering of the map is avoided.

Changing the zoom level results in the display of all waypoints at the given location with the necessary icons (exception:
several waypoints with equal coordinates).

![No blue dot waypoint icons](images/DocFaq/NoBlueDots.jpg "No blue dot waypoint icons")

## How to find information about a position (a POI) on the Web?

__(valid starting with QMS commit c57ba23001c7,  Wed Jul 25 13:02:57 2018)__

* Open a map view and move the mouse to the position (location) of interest.
* Right-click the mouse to open the context menu (this menu is included in the waypoint context menu, too).
* Select `Search Web for position` and then one of the preconfigured web services that provide information about the position. The default browser opens the web service which displays information about the selected position (if available).

    ![Web service selection](images/DocFaq/WebSearch1.jpg "Web service selection")
 
* Select the menu entries `Search Web for position - Configure services` to view the configuration of the default services and to add or remove web services with the help of the service configuration window:

    ![Web service configuration](images/DocFaq/WebSearch2.jpg "Web service configuration")

* To add a new service insert a name in the name field and a valid URL in the URL field. Use placeholders %1, %2 resp. %3 in the URL for the longitude, latitude resp. elevation. QMS replaces the placeholders with the data of the selected position.

    ![Web service added](images/DocFaq/WebSearch3.jpg "Web service added")

* Each web service (the default ones, too!) can be deleted. After deleting all web services QMS re-establishes the default configuration at the next start.

The configuration of web services is saved in the QMS INI file. 

Here is an overview of some web services (composed by Mitxel in the [QMapShack newsgroup](https://sourceforge.net/p/qlandkartegt/mailman/message/36444344), items labeled with an asterisk are default web services in QMS):

## What is the difference between `Copy position` and `Copy position (Grid)`?

A right-click in a map window at a certain position opens a context menu which offers (among others) the 2 choices:

* `Copy position`
* `Copy position (grid)`

In the first case the position is copied in the format used to display coordinates (see menu `View - Setup Coord. Format`),
e.g. `N49Â° 21.734 E012Â° 44.146`

In the second case, the position is copied as a pure grid coordinate.
For long/lat coordinates it is degrees (`49.599924 10.599991` or `-15.065344 -39.915421`). For northing/easting
coordinates it is meters. (`6307013m, 1415953m`)

_Remark:_ The copied position is the position selected with the mouse pointer in the map window. Its accuracy depends on the zoom level of the map. It is __not__ the position of a POI, waypoint, or trackpoint at the same location!


## Is there a possibility to display small roads/tracks in a vector map without zooming in too much?

**Source:** [www.naviboard.de](https://www.naviboard.de/thread/59676-qmapshack-zeigt-kleinere-wege-nur-bei-relativ-gro%C3%9Fen-ma%C3%9Fst%C3%A4ben-an/)

This problem appears with a vector map like [Freizeitkarte](http://www.freizeitkarte-osm.de/) where smaller
roads/tracks are only visible at a zoom level where the overview gets lost.

There is no such possibility in QMapShack. The detail levels for vector map data are defined by the map author and can't be
changed within QMapShack.

Users reported the following ways to improve the visibility of small roads:

* Choose the menu item `View - Setup Map View - Projections&Datum`
* Append to the given configuration string one of the following strings:
    * `+lat_ts=60` This sets the *latitude of true scale* for a Mercator projection. The closer you get to the polar regions the more the map will be skewed horizontally in comparison to the vertical scale. At the *latitude of true scale* (usually 0 for the equator) the scales are equal.
    * `+k_0=0.3` (**Source:** [gmane.comp.gis.qlandkartegt](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.qlandkartegt.user/2688))  This is an additional scale factor on the normal scale. A value of 1.0 will have no effect. Try to increase or decrease the given value to get the wanted result

## Does QMS support the use of single Garmin-style map tiles?

A map in the Garmin format consists of single map tiles plus a so-called _type file_ that describes how the elements
in the map should be displayed. The map tiles for a given area are typically packed together with a type file
into a special container format. A typical name for such a container file is `gmapsupp_xxx.img.

QMS does support maps loaded from gmapsupp container files. It doesn't allow the use of single tiles.

## How to change the layout of vector maps?

**(valid starting with QMS version 1.9.0)**

The layout of a vector map in QMS is defined by rules found in a so-called _type file_. Type files are contained in the _gmapsupp.img_ files required for 
the display of vector maps in QMS.
 
There is a strong relationship between the object types used in the description of the map data and the object types defined in a type file used for the display of the map.

The layout of a vector map can be changed in QMS by loading a new type file in the following way:

* open the __Maps__ tab in the workspace (select menu entries `Window - Maps` if tab is closed),
* open the map features window of the activated map for which the layout should be changed,

    ![Type file selection window](images/DocFaq/ChangeTypeFile.png "Type file selection")
   
* click on the `Load external type file` icon in the Type file row of this window and select a type file (extension __TYP__),
* click the `Forget external type file` icon to return to the original map layout.


The following image shows various layouts of a vector map obtained by using 4 different type files.


![Different vector map layouts](images/DocFaq/MapLayoutVariants.png "Different map layouts")

The first layout is the default one for the map, the second one displays the same map data as the first one but in a slightly different way.

The third and the fourth layouts illustrate how important and even dangerous layout changes can be when changing to an incompatible type file. If wanted, certain object
types are not displayed anymore (a motorway might be of no interest for a bicycle user). The fourth layout results from a type file not
built for the given vector map. As a result, even the motorway is not displayed correctly.

## Why is Google Terrain map a black-and-white map?

**Source:** [Discussion at https://sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/p/qlandkartegt/mailman/message/36769269)

[Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps) offers different map layers as overlays to some basic map. Among the overlay layers is a *Terrain* layer. 

Using various [TMS files](http://www.mtb-touring.net/qms/onlinekarten-einbinden/) these maps and their layers can be visualized in QMS. The next image shows in its upper part a map of some mountainous area without any overlays.

In the middle of this image, the Google terrain overlay is activated and shows the same area as the upper part. This overlay isn't a map in the proper sense of the word. It is used to show hillshading on some base map. The white/gray spots in this layer indicate hillshading.

Changing the opacity of the terrain layer with the help of the opacity slider reveals the hillshading on the base map (compare lower part of the next image with its upper and middle parts).

![Google terrain layer](images/DocFaq/MapLayers.jpg "Google terrain layer")

## Which raster map formats are supported?

There are various sources of raster maps in various formats.

QMS supports raster formats that are

* supported by the `GDAL` version used with QMapShack. Create a VRT file for the given raster map. Then it can be used in QMS. To get a list of formats supported 
  by `GDAL` run `gdaltransform.exe --formats` in a console window.
* of type RMAP, GEMF, JNX (formats directly loaded by QMS).

An advantage of the GEMF format is that reading the tiles from the map file is very fast.

The [MOBAC Mobile Atlas Creator](https://mobac.sourceforge.net/ "MOBAC main page") can be used as a source of raster maps. 
With the help of this application,
the user can load tiles of online maps as well as some other map formats and save them as raster maps. Use GEMF or RMAP as output formats.
For details check the [MOBAC Wiki](https://mobac.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page "MOBAC wiki main page").

The proprietary Mapsforge vector map format, which is rather popular on mobile phones, can be read by the latest version of MOBAC.
After converting a mapsforge map to a GEMF map with MOBAC, the GEMF map can be loaded with QMS. _Remark:_ This conversion can take
some time depending on the size and the structure of the map!

The [MAPC2MAPC64 map converter](https://mapc2mapc64.software.informer.com/5.1/ "MAPC2MAC64 map converter") is designed as a 
converter between various raster map formats.

**Remark about the QMS Windows version:** Many applications handling geodata use the `GDAL` package. Thus, several versions of this package
can be found on the computer with different support for raster map formats. To avoid version conflicts, QMS works exclusively with the `GDAL` version in its
installation directory. Thus, a change of the `GDAL` related environment variables doesn't result in a change of the `GDAL` version used by QMS.

## How to use Russian military and similar raster maps with QMapShack?

**Source:** Newsgroup thread [sourceforge.net/p/qlandkartegt](https://sourceforge.net/p/qlandkartegt/mailman/message/34518807/)

* Calibrated Russian military and other raster maps can be downloaded from various locations.
Some servers are
    * [loadmap.net](http://loadmap.net)
    * [https://gpska.yapl.ru](https://gpska.yapl.ru)
    * [http://satmaps.info/us/map-detector.php](https://satmaps.info/us/map-detector.php)

    When downloading a map tile 2 files are created: a GIF file (or another image file) with the raster map and an `OZIExplorer` MAP file with geodetic calibration data.

* QMapShack supports the use of raster maps via VRT files. These files can be created with the `GDALBuildVRT` tool
and can also be accessed from within QMapShack.
Doing so leads for the above-mentioned maps to an error message indicating that
georeference data can't be found within the MAP files.

* To make the raster map usable for QMapShack the following procedure (described for a Windows installation) can be used:
    * Ensure that the `GDAL` toolset and the `proj.dll` are in the QMapShack installation directory.
    * Add this directory to the PATH environment variable
    * Ensure that the `data` subdirectory of the QMapShack installation directory is properly installed
    * Add this directory to the GDAL_DATA environment variable
    * Move the image and the map file to a location where QMS is looking for maps or add the directory where
    these files are located to your QMapShack map paths.
    * Run

        `gdalwarp -of VRT full_path_to_your_raster_map.map full_path_to_your_raster_map.vrt`

    * _Remarks:_

        * It is unclear why `GDALBuildVRT` does not find the georeference information.
        * If there is a need to move the files discussed in this topic to a different location then repeat this procedure! The VRT file has a pointer to the relative or absolute path of the MAP file.

*  Raster maps may have borders. Use QMapTool to cut the map to the wanted shape without borders. For details compare section
   ["Raster maps"](DocMapsTipsRasterDEM#user-content-russian-army-maps)

## Why is a raster map not displayed?

**Source:** [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.qlandkartegt.user/2624](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.qlandkartegt.user/2624)

Consider the following hints:

* Use `gdalinfo` to verify if the required VRT file provides proper information. Keep in mind that the VRT file
  is just an XML wrapper around your
  real raster map file. It stores a path to that file. If the path changes,
  the VRT file has to be created again.
* If the map is loaded correctly, QMS may suppress drawing the map because it would take too long. In this case, the map boundary is still visible as a black frame as shown on the left of the following images.

    To force drawing of the map zoom in into the map.

    |Raster map not displayed | Raster map displayed|
    |--------|---------|
    |![Raster map boundary](images/DocFaq/RasterMap1.jpg "Raster map boundary") | ![Raster map](images/DocFaq/RasterMap2.jpg "Raster map")|

    If overview maps are supported (compare section [Basic knowledge about maps and DEM files](DocBasicsMapDem)) then the raster map is displayed with a lower level of detail when zooming out.

    ![Overview raster map](images/DocFaq/RasterMap4.jpg "Overview raster map")

    Data of raster maps may be outdated. To assess the data quality, use the possibility to overlay the raster map with a map providing recent data (e.g. online Google map) in QMS. The following example reveals that the German motorway A4 was reconstructed and avoids now some mountain areas.

    ![Raster map with overlay](images/DocFaq/RasterMap3.jpg "Raster map with overlay")

* If you have a layer of raster maps reading the files and scaling the content to an upper zoom level is
  getting more and more resource-intensive the more you zoom out. To avoid endless map loading, QMS will
  skip the map if the effort to display it is getting too large.
  However, if QMS detects overview levels attached to the map it will use them. `gdaladdo` is the tool to do so.
  Things are getting a bit more difficult for insane large map collections. `gdaladdo` will create an overview
  file over all maps combined in the VRT file. That might get too large. In this case, you have to create single
  overview files and combine them in a VRT file.

## How to find the location of a raster map?

A raster map requires a VRT file to display it in QMS. The location of a raster map is part of the information
of the VRT file.
The `gdalinfo` tool can be used to display this information in a readable way. Call the tool
from the commandline as follows:

    gdalinfo complete_path_to_vrt_file

Be sure the path to

* `gdalinfo` is set in the `PATH` environment variable,
* the GDAL `data` subdirectory is set in the `GDAL_DATA` environment variable.

Here is an example of the result:

    Files: c:\Maps\WT\500k--m32-2.vrt
           c:\Maps\WT\500k--m32-2.map

The coordinates given help to identify the location of the raster map on the QMS map screen. An easy way to do so is to
define a waypoint in QMS with coordinates at the center of the raster map defined above and then to double-click on the
waypoint. This centers the map in QMS to the waypoint and thus to the raster map.

## Is it possible to use several VRT files?

**Compare:** [naviboard.de newsgroup](https://www.naviboard.de/thread/60385-h%C3%B6hendaten-in-qmapshack-einbinden/)

Raster maps and DEM (**D**igital **E**levation **M**odel) data are supported in QMS via corresponding VRT files.
Several VRT files can be used. It is up to the user to organize the files properly.

## When to use GDALWarp to get VRT file?

The fastest way to create a VRT file for a raster map is the VRT builder included in QMS (select menu `Tool - VRT Builder`). This tool calls the GDAL `GDALBuildVRT.exe` for the creation of the VRT file. For some raster maps, the tool may fail with some error message, e.g. of the form

    Warning 6: gdalbuildvrt does not support rotated geo transforms.
    
The reason for this error message is that `GDALBuildVRT` can not create VRT files for raster maps that need additional projection transformations (in the example due to a rotated map). Such transformations can  be carried out with the help of `GDALWarp`. `GDALWarp` has VRT as one of its output formats. Thus, in the described situation run the following command from a commandline:

    gdalwarp -of VRT input_raster_file_name output_VRT_file_name
    
and use the VRT thus obtained in QMS.

_Remark:_ The VRT file obtained from `GDALWarp` has a more complicated structure than the one obtained from `GDALBuildVRT`. They show in the first line of the VRT file the additional info

    subClass="VRTWarpedDataset"
    
    

## Is it possible to use EPSG codes for the coordinate system setup?

_(inspired by [newsgroup discussion](https://sourceforge.net/p/qlandkartegt/mailman/message/36169806))_

Geodetic coordinate systems can be identified by a so-called EPSG code. If this code is known for a coordinate system, then it can be used
for the setup of the coordinate system used for the map or the map grid.

Examples:

* WGS 84, geographic:

        +init=epsg:4326
        
    more detailed proj.4 setting of this coordinate system:
  
        +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs
    
* WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator (selected in QMS/QMT via "World Mercator (OSM) - datum WGS_1984")

        +init=epsg:3857
    
    more detailed proj.4 setting of this coordinate system:

        +proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +wktext +no_defs  

Parts of the coordinate system (projection, datum ellipsoid) can be described in a similarly if the EPSG code is known.  



## How to use WMTS files without ResourceURL?

Some online map servers can be accessed via the WMTS service. 

QMS supports WMTS services directly or by wrapping them into TMS services (TMS files). Examples for calling a WMTS service via TMS can be found in section ["Use WMTS server as TMS server"][TMS4WMTS]. The current section gives some more insight into the subtleties of using WMTS files in QMS and of building the resource URL used in such a TMS wrapper.

The [WMTS standard][WMTSSpec] specifies several exchange mechanisms between clients and servers. The most important ones are

* `RESTful` operations (a resource-oriented architectural style),
* `KVP` operations (a procedure-oriented architectural style, KVP = Key-Value-Pair).

The WMTS specification allows a wide range of possibilities to describe the necessary map information in a WMTS capabilities file. QMS can handle only some of them.
It assumes that the following requirements are fulfilled:

* The filename extension of a WMTS capabilities file must be `wmts`.
* The server supports RESTful `Get` operations.
* A `ResourceURL` entry can be found for each layer in the WMTS capabilities file. QMS can't display a map without such a piece of information. WMTS services with the support of RESTful operations provide this information whereas services that support only KVP operations in most cases don't provide it explicitly.
* The coordinate reference systems (CRS) linked in all tile matrix sets in the WMTS capabilities file must be known to the Proj.4 version used in QMS.
* WMTS server access should be without user authentication (username/password).

If a WMTS capabilities file doesn't satisfy these requirements, it can't be used directly for map display in QMS. However, there are several ways to meet the above requirements and display the map anyway. But not each of these ways will be successful!

* In the case that Restful operations are not supported, a missing `ResourceURL` can be built from other pieces of information in the WMTS file and inserted into the WMTS file. In many cases, QMS can successfully load online maps with such an updated WMTS file. 
* A layer can have several linked tile matrix sets. If the CRS of the first one can't be handled by QMS/Proj.4, but another one can, then put the link to this tile matrix set to the first position in the WMTS file.
* If the server requires user authentication, then insert the authentication data manually into the resource URL in the WMTS file. An example is shown in the section ["How to build the URL when using WMS via TMS"][TMS4WMS1].
* Instead of modifying the WMTS file, it is possible to build a TMS file with the necessary resource URL and load the online map with the help of this TMS wrapper. This approach is described in this section for layers that support CRS EPSG:3857. The resource URL in a TMS file is bound to one layer and one of the tile matrix sets linked to the layer. Authentication information can be included in the resource URL, too. 

The possibility to use TMS files instead of WMTS ones leads to yet another advantage: A WMTS service can load and display several layers but in a given fixed order only. A user may want to display only a certain part of these layers in an order different from the one used in the WMTS file. With the help of a TMS file, this can be achieved easily.

Remember when using a WMTS or TMS file that only certain areas and zoom levels might be supported by the server.

### Add missing resource URL to WMTS file


Let's take as an example a [WMTS capabilities file][ign.fr.wmts] of the French [IGN geoserver][ign.fr].

Here is some extract of this XML file (some line numbers are added as a reference for the following discussion):

```xml
...
<ows:OperationsMetadata>
...
1 <ows:Operation name="GetTile">
    <ows:DCP>
      <ows:HTTP>
2       <ows:Get xlink:href="https://wxs.ign.fr/beta/geoportail/wmts?">
          <ows:Constraint name="GetEncoding">
3           <ows:AllowedValues>
4             <ows:Value>KVP</ows:Value>
...
<Contents>
5 <Layer>
6   <ows:Title>DÃ©limitation parcellaire AOC viticole</ows:Title>
    ...
7   <ows:Identifier>Aire-Parcellaire</ows:Identifier>
    <Style isDefault="true">
      ...
8     <ows:Identifier>normal</ows:Identifier>
      ...
    </Style>
9   <Format>image/png</Format>
    ...
    <TileMatrixSetLink>
10    <TileMatrixSet>PM</TileMatrixSet>
      ...
    </TileMatrixSetLink>
  </Layer>
...
  <TileMatrixSet>
11   <ows:Identifier>PM</ows:Identifier>
12     <ows:SupportedCRS>EPSG:3857</ows:SupportedCRS>
```

To check whether adding a resource URL is necessary, proceed as follows:

1. Find each `Layer` tag (line 5) in the WMTS file.
1. For each `Layer` element (tag) check, if it has a child with the tag `ResourceURL`.
    * If yes, then check the next layer.
    * If no (as can be seen in the example), then a `ResourceURL` element (tag) must be built before the WMTS file can be used in QMS. This resource URL must be inserted as a child element to the `Layer` element.
1. Find the entry `<ows:Operation name="GetTile">` (line 1) in the WMTS file. Such an entry can be missing in the WMTS capabilities file but then there must be a `ResourceURL` child element in each `Layer` element.
1. Check, if the text of one of the `<ows:Value>` entries (line 4) below the entry `<ows:AllowedValues>` (line 3) is `KVP`. 
    * If yes, find and remember the URL part of the entry `<ows:Get xlink:href="some_url">` (line 2).
    * If no, then either a resource URL is defined for each layer or a missing resource URL can't be added to this layer.
          
If a new resource URL has to be built, then this can't be the case for servers supporting the resource-oriented architectural style. Therefore, the server should support the procedure-oriented style and, consequently, the following procedure-oriented (KVP) template can be used for building a resource URL:

```xml
<ResourceURL format="[format]" 
             resourceType="tile" 
             template="[url]
             SERVICE=WMTS&amp;
             REQUEST=GetTile&amp;
             VERSION=1.0.0&amp;
             LAYER=[layer]&amp;
             STYLE=[style]&amp;
             FORMAT=[format]&amp;
             TILEMATRIXSET=[tilematrixset]&amp;
             TILEMATRIX={TileMatrix}&amp;
             TILEROW={TileRow}&amp;
             TILECOL={TileCol}"/>
```

(some line breaks have been added for better visibility of the structure of the string)

The values to be replaced in the template are:

* [format]: replace with the text of a `Format` child element of the layer (line 9), preferably `image/png` or `image/jpeg`.
* [url]: replace with the URL found in the `xlink:href` attribute ("some_url", line 2) below the `GetTile` element (line 1). Be sure, there is exactly one question mark at the end of this string!
* [layer]: replace with the text in the `Identifier` tag of the considered layer (line 7).
* [style]: can be replaced either with the string `{Style}` for automatic selection of the first layer style by QMS or with the text of the `Identifier` tag below the `Style` tag of the layer (line 8).
* [tilematrixset]: can be replaced either with the string `{TileMatrixSet}` for automatic selection of a tile matrix set by QMS or with the text of one of the `TileMatrixSet` elements in the layer (line 10, child of a `TileMatrixSetLink`).

The complete new resource URL element for the given example is

```xml
<ResourceURL resourceType="tile" 
             format="image/png"
             template="https://wxs.ign.fr/beta/geoportail/wmts?
             SERVICE=WMTS&
             REQUEST=GetTile&
             VERSION=1.0.0&
             LAYER=Aire-Parcellaire&
             STYLE={Style}&
             FORMAT=image/png&
             TILEMATRIXSET={TileMatrixSet}&
             TILEMATRIX={TileMatrix}&
             TILEROW={TileRow}&
             TILECOL={TileCol}"/>
```

Add this new XML entry (without line breaks) as last child node to the `Layer` tag (just before the closing `</Layer>` tag) in the WMTS file and save this file.

### Build TMS file for WMTS file

The map server response for a TMS or WMTS service request is a map tile. The tiles for both service types are identified using different rules. As a consequence, calling a WMTS service from a TMS service must include a rule for converting the TMS tile identifiers to WMTS identifiers. These rules also depend on the used coordinate reference system (CRS).

Since many servers support the world-wide coordinate reference system EPSG:3857 (WGS 84/Pseudo-Mercator, axes: easting, northing in meters), only this CRS is discussed below. 

Each layer used in a TMS wrapper for a WMTS file has to be linked with one of the tile matrix sets belonging to this layer. This tile matrix set must support the CRS EPSG:3857. If none of the tile matrix sets of a layer supports EPSG:3857, then the building of a TMS file is not possible.

A TMS file can be used for rendering in QMS several layers from one or several WMTS files.

The structure of the resource URL depends on the architectural style (`KVP` or `RESTful`) supported by the server. Compare line 4 in the example capabilities file shown above to find the supported styles.

#### Procedure-oriented style (`KVP` style)

Here is a template TMS XML file for procedure-oriented requests (`KVP` style):

```xml
<TMS>
<Layer idx="0">
<Title>[title]</Title>
<Script><![CDATA[(
function convert(z1,x1,y1)
{return "[url]
        SERVICE=WMTS&
        VERSION=1.0.0&
        REQUEST=GetTile&
        LAYER=[layer]&
        STYLE=[style]&
        FORMAT=[format]&
        TileMatrixSet=[tilemmatrixset]&
        TileMatrix="+z1+"&
        TileRow="+y1+"&
        TileCol="+x1}
)]]></Script>
</Layer>
<Copyright>[copyright]</Copyright>
</TMS>
``` 

(some line breaks have been added for better visibility of the structure of the string, remove them before using the TMS file!)

Here, the term [title] resp. [copyright] is to be replaced by a descriptive title resp. copyright notice. The text of the `Title` child element of the `Layer` element (line 6) or the global title in the WMTS capabilities file can be used as [title] (line 6).

The values for [url], [format], [style], and [layer] are found as described in the [previous subsection][NoURL].

[tilematrixset] has to be replaced with the text of one of the `TileMatrixSet` elements in the layer (line 10). Because of the limitation to certain CRS the tile matrix set must support CRS EPSG:3857. To find the CRS for a tile matrix set go to the tag `SupportedCRS` below the `Identifier` tag of your tile matrix set and check, if it is EPSG:3857 (line 11, 12).

The final TMS file for the given example is

```xml
<TMS>
<Layer idx="0">
<Title>DÃ©limitation parcellaire AOC viticole</Title>
<Script><![CDATA[(
function convert(z1,x1,y1)
{return "https://wxs.ign.fr/beta/geoportail/wmts?
        SERVICE=WMTS&
        VERSION=1.0.0&
        REQUEST=getTile&
        LAYER=Aire-Parcellaire&
        STYLE=normal&
        FORMAT=image/png&        
        TileMatrixSet=PM&
        TileMatrix="+z1+"&
        TileRow="+y1+"&
        TileCol="+x1}
)]]></Script>
</Layer>
<Copyright>IGN.fr</Copyright>
</TMS>
``` 

#### Resource-oriented style (`RESTful` style)

In this case, each layer should have a `ResourceURL` in the capabilities file pointing to a URL with the structure:

```XML
[url]/
[layer]/
[style]/
[tilematrixset]/
"+z1+"/
"+y1+"/
"+x1+".[formatext]
```

The values for [layer], [style], and [tilematrixset] are found as described for the `KVP` style.

To find the value for [url] go to the `template` attribute of the `ResourceURL` tag and use the first part of the value of this template. This part ends with `tile/1.0.0`.

[formatext] is the filename extension for the used image format in [format] (`png` or `jpg`).

Here is an example for a resource URL:

```XML
"https://sgx.geodatenzentrum.de/wmts_topplus_open/tile/1.0.0/
web/
default/
WEBMERCATOR/
"+z1+"/
"+y1+"/
"+x1+".png"/>
```

In this example the [url] part is `https://sgx.geodatenzentrum.de/wmts_topplus_open/tile/1.0.0` and the [formatext] value is `png`.


The complete TMS file (using values from the relevant [WMTS capabilities file][BKGTop] and including 2 layers) is

```XML
<TMS>
<Layer idx="0">
<Title>TopPlusOpen</Title>
<Script><![CDATA[(
function convert(z1,x1,y1)
{return "https://sgx.geodatenzentrum.de/wmts_topplus_open/tile/1.0.0/
       web/
       default/
       WEBMERCATOR/
       "+z1+"/
       "+y1+"/
       "+x1+".png"}
)]]></Script>
</Layer>
<Layer idx="1">

```



## How to build the URL when using WMS via TMS?
 
Many online map servers can be accessed via the WMS service. An advantage of a WMS service is that it typically provides access to many different types of information  organized in (map) layers.
 
QMS supports WMS services by wrapping them into TMS services (TMS files). Examples for calling a WMS service via TMS can be found in section ["Use WMS server as TMS server"][TMS4WMS]. The current section gives some more insight into the subtleties of building the URL used in such a TMS file.
 
The map server response for a TMS or WMS service request is a map tile. The tiles for both service types are identified using different rules. As a consequence, calling a WMS service from a TMS service must include a rule for converting the TMS tile identifiers to WMS identifiers. These rules also depend on the used coordinate reference system (CRS).

Since most servers support the world-wide coordinate reference systems EPSG:4326 (WGS84, axes: latitude, longitude in degrees) and/or EPSG:3857 (WGS 84/Pseudo-Mercator, axes: easting, northing in meters), only these 2 CRS are discussed below. If neither of these 2 CRS is supported, then a coordinate transformation formula must be known for building a TMS wrapper for the WMS file.
 

The TMS file for the CRS `EPSG:4326` has the form

```xml
<TMS>
<Layer idx="0">
<Title>TITLE</Title>
<Script><![CDATA[(
 function convert(z,x,y)
{function tile2lon(x, z) {return x / Math.pow(2.0, z) * 360.0 -180.;}
  function tile2lat(y, z) {
    n = Math.PI - (2.0 * Math.PI * y) / Math.pow(2.0, z);
    return (Math.atan(Math.sinh(n)))*180.0/Math.PI;
  }
  north = tile2lat(y, z);
  south = tile2lat(y + 1, z);
  west = tile2lon(x, z);
  east = tile2lon(x + 1, z);
  bbox = south + "," + west +"," + north + "," + east;
  return "URL" + bbox
}
)]]></Script>
</Layer>
<Copyright>COPYRIGHT</Copyright>
</TMS>
```

The TMS file for the CRS `EPSG:3857` has the form

```xml
<TMS>
<Layer idx="0">
<Title>TITLE</Title>
<Script><![CDATA[(
function convert(z1,x1,y1)
{ function M(n){return 256*n*(156543.03392804062/(1<<z1))-20037508.342789244}
  y=(1<<z1)-1-y1;
  bbox=M(x1)+','+M(y)+','+M(x1+1)+','+M(y+1);
  return "URL" + bbox
}
)]]></Script>
</Layer>
<Copyright>COPYRIGHT</Copyright>
</TMS>
```

Thus, both variants of TMS files differ by the rules for finding the bounding box coordinates.

In both cases the term `TITLE` resp. `COPYRIGHT` is to be replaced by a descriptive title resp. copyright notice.

The placeholder `URL` is to be replaced by a complete URL. All values required for building this URL can be found in the WMS capabilities file for the given WMS server. The capabilities file can be downloaded from the homepage of the server. Details are explained using the following extract of a WMS capabilities file for a [Spanish WMS server][ign.es] as an example.


```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

        ...
            </Style>
          </Layer>
        ...
        </Layer>
      </Capability>
    </WMS_Capabilities>
```


A complete WMS URL is built by choosing values for the following URL parameters:

* The value of the attribute `xlink:href` in the `GetMap/.../OnlineResource` tag (line 4) as server address. _Attention:_ There must be exactly one question mark at the end of this value. If there is a question mark within this value, then drop everything following this question mark.
* SERVICE: must be `WMS`.
* VERSION: must be either `1.1.0` or `1.3.0`. This is the value of the attribute `version` of the `WMS_Capabilities` tag (line 1).
* REQUEST: must be `GetMap`.
* LAYERS: a comma-separated list of names of layers to display. Names are taken from the text of the `Names` child tags of the `Layer` tag (line 6). The `Layer` tags in a WMS capabilities file are in a hierarchical (tree-like) order. Some values (among them the `CRS` values) are inherited by the child elements. Only layers with a `Name` tag have map tiles. If some required value can't be found on the level of the selected layer, then check, if the value can be found in one of the predecessor nodes of this layer.
* STYLES: defines the styles for the displayed layers (preferably `default`). For each used layer the value must be taken from the text of the `Style/Name` child tag of the layer (line7).
* FORMAT: should be `image/png` or `image/jpeg` (the so-called MIME type). Recommendation: prefer `image/png`. The value is taken from the text of a `Format` tag below the `GetMap` tag (line 3).
* SRS/CRS: must be `EPSG:4326` or `EPSG:3857`. Represents the Coordinate Reference System. Use `CRS` with WMS version 1.3.0 as parameter name, otherwise `SRS`. Check, if one of the CRS is listed below the `Layer` tag (lines 5). If not, then a TMS file can't be built.
* BBOX: represents the boundary box of the requested image tiles. Its format is xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax. The values depend on the selected CRS. Placeholders have to be used instead of specific values which are replaced with a concrete value when QMS requests a map tile.
* WIDTH: should be `256`. Width of the requested image in pixels.
* HEIGHT: should be `256`. Height of the requested image in pixels.


Here is the complete final URL for the discussed example with some comments:

```
1   http://www.ign.es/wms-inspire/mapa-raster?
2     SERVICE=WMS&
3     REQUEST=GetMap&
4     VERSION=1.3.0&
5     LAYERS=mtn_rasterizado&
6     FORMAT=image/png&
7     CRS=EPSG:4326&
8     STYLES=default&
9     WIDTH=256&
10    HEIGHT=256&
11    BBOX=
```

Line numbers and line breaks are inserted for discussion and better visibility of the structure. They have to be removed in the final result!

* Line 1: the URL of the WMS server. Be sure, exactly one question mark is at the last position.
* Line 4: the WMS version supported by the server.
* Line 5: a comma-separated names list of layers to display. In the example just 1 layer.
* Line 6: the image format to be used.
* Line 7: the CRS to be used. The WMS version `1.3.0` implies that the parameter name is `CRS`.
* Line 8: a comma-separated list of styles for the display of the layers. In the example just one entry for the 1 layer used.

**Hints:** 
 
* When checking a map rendered with the help of a TMS file in QMS, then pay attention to the following facts:
    * Map tiles might be available only for certain regions (defined by some bounding box).
    * Map tiles might be displayed only on some zoom levels. Try to find them in QMS.
    * The server might be sensitive to the correct `STYLES` values of a layer.
    * The requested service might be not or no more available on the server. Check the QMS debug log to get more information.
    * In case of trouble, take the resource URL for EPSG:4326, fill in appropriate latitude and longitude coordinates for  your region as bounding box values and open the resource URL in a web browser. An image or an error message should be displayed. Example for the discussed Spanish server:
    
            http://www.ign.es/wms-inspire/mapa-raster?SERVICE=WMS&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&VERSION=1.3.0&LAYERS=mtn_rasterizado&FORMAT=image/png&CRS=EPSG:4326&STYLES=default&WIDTH=256&HEIGHT=256&BBOX=40.4,-3.6,40.5,-3.5
        
* There is some confusion with the coordinate order when using `EPSG:4326`. WMS version 1.3.0 mostly supports the latitude/longitude order. Some servers, mainly those with WMS version 1.1.0, assume the opposite order. In this case, the `bbox` line in the TMS file must be replaced by
 
    `west + "," + south + "," + east + "," + north;`
    
    Checking the bounding boxes for EPGS:4326 in the WMS capabilities file can help to reveal the proper coordinate order. Here are a few examples:
    
    * `<BoundingBox CRS="EPSG:4326" minx="-88" miny="-180" maxx="88" maxy="180"/>`. 
    
        Obviously, the y-coordinate describes longitudes, the x-coordinate describes latitudes. The region defined by the bounding box is the whole world without polar areas.
        
    * `<BoundingBox CRS="EPSG:4326" maxx="53.2057" maxy="14.3058" minx="50.8002" miny="9.0407"/>`. 
    
        This bounding box belongs to a German map server. With this additional information the coordinate orientation is easily found: the y-coordinate describes longitudes, the x-coordinate describes latitudes. 
        
    * `<LatLonBoundingBox maxy="84" maxx="-52" miny="41" minx="-141"/>`. 
    
        This bounding box belongs to a Canadian map server. With this additional information the coordinate orientation is easily found: the y-coordinate describes latitudes, the x-coordinate describes longitudes. 

* Some servers require a user authentification and, possibly, some user key. This information must be included in the server URL. An example is the server of the French [Institut national de lâinformation gÃ©ographique et forestiÃ¨re (IGN)][ign.fr]. Here, the user has to [register][ign.register] and to get a user login and a user key.
 
    Having registered, an example of a user-specific URL is
 
    `https://user:password@wxs.ign.fr/userkey/geoportail/r/wms`

* A TMS file can consist of several `<Layer idx=".."> ... </Layer>` blocks even if they use different servers and CRS. If several layer blocks are used, then the `idx` attributes must be numbered consecutively starting from 0. Here is an example TMS file with 3 layers:

        <TMS>

    The first 2 layers are layers for the boundaries and the roads in Canada. The third layer is a combination of boundaries and roads. It shows the roads as an overlay on the boundaries layer. The layers are listed in the `Layers` parameter. For each layer, there is a style entry in the `Styles` parameter.

 
 
## What are the differences between the WMTS and the WMS approach in QMS?
 
Many map servers offer their services in WMTS and WMS form. The following features of the services may help to make an appropriate choice.
 
* WMTS services are supported by QMS, WMS services aren't.
* WMTS files without a resource URL for each layer can't be used in QMS.
* A wide range of CRS is supported for WMTS services.
* WMS services can only be used with the help of a TMS wrapper and only if a layer supports CRS EPSG:4326 and EPSG:3857.
* Layer handling differs:
    * WMTS: All layers are displayed at once, the user can make a selection in QMS, but can't change the order of rendering the layers.
    * WMS: When building the resource URL for the TMS wrapper file, the user can choose the necessary layers and their order.
* The rules described here for TMS wrappers assume that the 
    * WMTS service supports EPSG:3857,
    * WMS service supports EPSG:3857 or EPSG:4326.


## How to get information about a WMTS or WMS service?

Often WMTS and WMS services offer many map layers and coordinate reference systems (CRS). Their proper and successful selection can therefore become difficult and require additional information. A tool that can provide additional insight in online maps downloaded with a WMTS or WMS service is [GDAL][gdal]. GDAL is required when running QMS. For Windows systems, it is installed together with QMS into the QMS installation folder.

Map information can be obtained with the following steps (details can be found in the GDAL [WMTS][gdal.wmts] and [WMS][gdal.wms] driver documentation):

1. __Preliminary remark:__ The success of the described procedure heavily depends on the features of the map server and the GDAL driver. Therefore, the procedure may fail! 
1. Open a console window and be sure that the GDAL tools are on your path.
1. If a capabilities file is not yet available, download it from the server. Here are some examples:
    * [http://geoportal-zm.cuzk.cz/WMTS_ZM/service.svc/get?service=WMTS&request=GetCapabilities:][cuzuk.cz] WMTS service in procedure-oriented style.
    * [http://maps.wien.gv.at/wmts/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml:][wien] WMTS service in resource-oriented style.
    * [https://isk.geobasis-bb.de/mapproxy/dtk50farbe/service/wms?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities:][geobb] WMS service.

    It depends on the server, if the procedure- or the resource-oriented style has to be used to get the capabilities file.
    
1. Save the obtained capabilities information in a file with the name `Capabilities.xml` (this ambiguous filename is chosen to make the following discussion easier).
1. From the console call

    `gdalinfo "Capabilities.xml"` (add paths, if necessary!)
    
    The result of this call is a description of the essential features of the online map. Here is part of it for the first example:

        ...

    The `Subdatasets` part is the most interesting part. It lists each map layer with one feasible tile matrix and one coordinate reference system (CRS).
    
1. Select one of the subdatasets (in the example: `SUBDATASET_12`) to get more information about it. To do this, call

    `gdalinfo WMTS:Capabilities.xml,layer=zm,tilematrixset=wgs84:geographic2d:epsg:4326` 
    
    (the `gdalinfo` parameter is taken from the value of the `SUBDATASET_12_NAME` field)

1. For the selected layer and (one of) its subdataset(s) now call

        gdal_translate "WMTS:Capabilities.xml,layer=zm,tilematrixset=wgs84:geographic2d:epsg:4326" zm.tiff -of GTiff -outsize 2000 2000   
    
    The result is a georeferenced TIFF file `zm.tiff` with size 2000 x 2000. This image file shows the complete map of the layer.
    
1. Information about WMS services is obtained in the same way. The following example demonstrates some additional possibilities. When calling
`gdalinfo Capabilities.xml` for the third example, i.e. for a WMS example, then the layer information returned is

        Subdatasets:
          SUBDATASET_1_NAME=WMS:https://isk.geobasis-bb.de/mapproxy/dtk50farbe/service/wms?
             SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=bb_dtk50_farbe&CRS=CRS:84&
             BBOX=11.152768795679583,51.263517011631606,15.392977959312176,53.60940433664921
          SUBDATASET_1_DESC=Digitale Topographische Karte 1:50 000 Farbe
        
    To get a TIFF image call next 

        gdal_translate "WMS:https://isk.geobasis-bb.de/mapproxy/dtk50farbe/service/wms?
               SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=bb_dtk50_farbe&CRS=CRS:84
               &BBOX=11.152768795679583,51.263517011631606,15.392977959312176,53.60940433664921" 
                bb.tiff -of GTiff -outsize 2000 2000

    (line breaks added!)
    
    This call fails with the error message "_The server returned exception code 'InvalidCRS': unsupported crs: CRS:84_". This error is typical for layers with many and especially regional coordinate systems.
    
    Looking into the WMS capabilities file reveals that the layer `bb_dtk50_farbe` supports also other CRS, among them the well-known CRS EPSG:3857 which can be used in a TMS file for QMS. Information about this CRS is obtained with the call
    
        gdalinfo "WMS:https://isk.geobasis-bb.de/mapproxy/dtk50farbe/service/wms?
          SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&CRS=EPSG:3857"
    
    which results in
    
        Subdatasets:
          SUBDATASET_1_NAME=WMS:https://isk.geobasis-bb.de/mapproxy/dtk50farbe/service/wms?
          SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=bb_dtk50_farbe&CRS=EPSG:3857&
          BBOX=1241520.543270162,6668039.871372213,1713538.4682227147,7096526.47996629
          SUBDATASET_1_DESC=Digitale Topographische Karte 1:50 000 Farbe    
          
    _Remark:_ This may fail for layers that inherit some of their properties from parent layers.
    
    The main new piece of information is the bounding box for CRS EPSG:3857 which is required in the call for a TIFF image:
    
        gdal_translate  "WMS:https://isk.geobasis-bb.de/mapproxy/dtk50farbe/service/wms?
            SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=bb_dtk50_farbe&CRS=EPSG:3857&
            BBOX=1241520.543270162,6668039.871372213,1713538.4682227147,7096526.47996629"
              bb.tiff -of GTiff -outsize 2000 2000

    This call results in a TIFF file showing the complete map for the selected layer. Thus, this layer can be rendered in QMS with a TMS file.
    
    If bounding box data is not found or not found for the CRS under consideration, then use the area you are interested in as a bounding box. Use the coordinates of the considered CRS! Prefer CRS EPSG:4326 where geographic coordinates can be used.
