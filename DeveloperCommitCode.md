# Commit Code #

*Please do not send patches!* Use a pull request. In the past patches proved to be very unreliable. Either they conflicted with the moving forward state of the repository or there where some line break quirks between Windows and Linux.

Anyway a pull request is a much cleaner way for you to develop your feature. And for us to review and merge the request.

## Pull Request

BitBucket offers you to fork the QMapShack repository. By that you have your own repository and you can do whatever you want to do. There is also a function to keep your fork in sync with the main repository. Once you are done and you think the stuff should really go into the main repository, you can start a pull request.

This request will be reviewed. Maybe it needs a few fixes. Anyway, if the code has been reviewed and obviously does not break anything, it will be merged into the main repository.
