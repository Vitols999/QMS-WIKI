# Frequently Asked Questions - Project Pages

## Why do you insist on using the templates

Sometimes bug reports or feature request are done in a pretty
sloppy way, lacking crucial information. Templates help users
to provide that information and to think about what they want.
And they help us to communicate what information we need.

The experience of the last years showed that a good bug report
or feature request can save time as we developer immediately
understand the problem without going back and forward retrieving
information by asking for each missing detail.

Therefore providing decent information when creating a new issue
is also showing respect for the work done in spare time by the
developers.

## But I always write decent descriptions in issues and hate templates

Yes, that might be true but always keep in mind that others might take
your issue as example for theirs without having your brilliant ability.
The result is a badly written issue report ignoring the template. The
excuse: Other issues are the same. Therefor be a good team mate in every
aspect. Give a good example. Use the templates.
