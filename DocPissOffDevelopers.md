# How to piss off open source developers

...ah let me explain this a bit first. This "list" was a result of a very 
unpleasant and annoying discussion way back in the days of QMapShack. 
The tone it's written in is pretty harsh. But the statements are valid. 
I could write it a bit more diplomatic but by that it would kind of lose
it's entertaining value. That's why I leave it as is. Please, read it with a 
grain of humor.

1. Be a smart ass: You don't have your own open source project? You
don't even know the topic in detail? No worries, be yourself and brag
about what you think is best for the project. Show real astonishment
about why this and that has not been done since whatever time. You can
always claim you know better because it's more or less guaranteed that
you never have to prove it.

2. Poisoned praise: A few warm words of praise are always welcome. But
not if you expect something right in exchange. "This is one of the best
applications if not the best. But..<list of requirements>" If it would
be the best application for you, you wouldn't have to request stuff. So
spare everyone the shallow words if you bluntly want something. They
don't make it better, they make it worse. _(Small side fact: In 10 years_
_I got five mails with just a plain thank you. Nothing else, just a thank_
_you. Five incredible valuable mails to me.)_

3. Software X has it. Why is it missing in your software? _Well...._
_probably because this is software Y and not X. If you want X, use X._

4. What is the sense in using your software if there is other software?
_Damn and I wonder since years why my business plan does not pay off. I_
_knew I made something wrong._

5. It can't be really much effort to implement this. _Wow, an expert._
_Sure, if you think so, why didn't you spend the naught of a time and_
_send a patch._

6. Why is there no <add stuff that needs resources, licenses or
maintenance>. _Yes, sorry, please file an issue at our customer help desk_
_for refund._

7. It would be so much better if you supply the resources instead of making everyone organizing that stuff on their own. _Yes, sure, I like to have it easy, too. But please visit 6)._

8. My spare time is too valuable than to do... _Great, so you think your spare time is more valuable than the one of anyone else? You made my day._

9. I haven't spent much time with your software but I have great plans
and you have to implement..<opening issues> _Is it really that hard to_
_ask if the software is already able to do what you need, before you_
_squeeze in issues in the tracker? There is my email, there is IRC, there_
_is this mailing list, there are several forums I respond to. The issue_
_tracker is for bugs and requests that have been discussed. Don't spam it_
_with help requests masked as feature request. Or even worse, flagged as bug._

10. "It's not working" is not a bug report. A feature request hardly done
in one sentence. That text of conduct you get when creating a bug is
really meant seriously.

Now, go and give hell to your favorite open source developer! :wink:
