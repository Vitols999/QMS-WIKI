# Working with Projects

A project is a container that contains GIS items like waypoints, tracks, etc. There are several sources for projects. A single GPX file is a project. Or a query on a GIS server like Google. 

You can create a new project, start a search or close all projects by the _Workspace_ menu:

You get the same menu with a right click when no item in the data view's workspace list is selected.
